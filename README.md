- The Horiseon website highlights the company's marketing expertise specifically targeting the areas of SEO and social media influence.

# Code Refactor Project

- In this project I was given the Horiseon website that needed the code refactored.  Some of the changes I made include...

    1. Added semantic elements to the index.html so screen readers can understand the flow of the website logically and to improve SEO.

    2. Changed class/id names to consolidate redundent code, improved layout for better readability, and added comments to make code concise and easy to understand.

    3. Added multiple commit messages after editing each section.

    4. fixed navigation links and added alt descriptions to all images.

    5. created a repository on GitHub at URL https://github.com/mmelendez3/hor-refactor
    
    6. This is the address of the live URL https://mmelendez3.github.io/hor-refactor/

    7. Here is a screenshot of the finished website.
